## 🚀 **My DevOps Learning Journey – Why I’m Starting This Blog**

### **Hey everyone! 👋**

I’m **Anjal Poudel**, a **Cloud & DevOps learner** currently pursuing my **B.Tech (2nd year)**. I’m deeply passionate about **automation, cloud infrastructure, containerization, and DevOps workflows**.

I’ve been learning **AWS, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and more**, and I wanted a place to **document my journey**—so here I am, starting this blog! 🚀

---

## **Why Am I Writing This Blog?**

There are already tons of amazing resources explaining DevOps concepts, so instead of just repeating information, I want to share my **personal learning experiences** here:

✅ The **challenges** I face while learning  
✅ The **mistakes** I make (so you can avoid them!)  
✅ My **“aha!” moments** when things finally make sense  
✅ How I **apply DevOps concepts** in real projects

I believe learning is most effective when shared, and by writing about my experiences, I hope to **connect with other learners, DevOps engineers, and cloud enthusiasts**.

---

## **What Will I Be Writing About?**

Starting today, I’ll be sharing my **experiences** while learning **DevOps tools and workflows**.

📌 **Blog Frequency** – I’ll be posting **at least one blog per week** about the new tech I’ve learned.  
📌 **Topics Covered** – I’ll write about **what I learned, how I learned it, and the challenges I faced** along the way.

So far, I have already explored major DevOps tools like **Git, Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, and Terraform**. Right now, I am learning **Kubernetes**, and my next blog will be about my experience with **K8s**!

## **Join Me on This Journey!**

If you’re also learning DevOps or looking to get started, feel free to **follow my blog** and **connect with me on LinkedIn**. I’d love to network with fellow DevOps and cloud learners.

💡 **Let’s grow and learn together!** 🚀
